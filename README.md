# Fujitsu Si-R series router VPN configuration transrator

There is no Fujitsu router listed in the AWS site to site VPN configuration file download.
So I'll translate it from the generic configuration file.

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.
2. In the navigation pane, choose Site-to-Site VPN Connections.
3. Select your VPN connection and choose Download Configuration.
4. Choose Generic. Choose Download.
5. Paste the contents of configuration file and transrate it.
